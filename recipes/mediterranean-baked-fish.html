    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning, divided </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pitted and sliced Castelvetrano olives</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds fish fillets, about 1/2-inch thick, patted dry (see note)</li>
        <li>cooked rice or pasta (optional)</li>
        <li>fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>




    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-safe nonstick skillet over medium heat. When oil shimmers, add onions and cook,<br />
            stirring frequently, until onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic, and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add cherry tomatoes and wine, and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.<br />
            to combine, and cook about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in sliced olives, chopped spinach, and cream.</li>
        <li>Nestle fillets into vegetable mixture, sprinkle each fillet with salt and pepper, and drizzle remaining olive oil over the entire dish.<br />
            Brush the olive oil to cover the surface of each fillet. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.<br />
            An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve with hot, cooked pasta or rice, and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
